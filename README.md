# Notes

The Notes Application is a powerful note-taking application developed using Kotlin and the latest Jetpack Compose UI toolkit. It allows users to create, save, and organize their notes efficiently. The application incorporates Dagger Hilt for dependency injection and follows the MVVM clean architecture pattern to ensure a maintainable and scalable codebase.

## Features

Create and save notes: Users can create new notes and save them with a title, content, and optional tags for easy organization.

Archive functionality: Users can archive their notes to keep them separate from the main note list while still retaining easy access.

Trash functionality: Deleted notes are moved to the trash, allowing users to restore or permanently delete them.

Search: Users can search for specific notes based on keywords or tags, making it easy to find relevant information quickly.
